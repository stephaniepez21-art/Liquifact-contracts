#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]
//! LiquiFact Escrow Contract
//!
//! Holds investor funds for an invoice until settlement.
//! - SME receives stablecoin when funding target is met ([`LiquifactEscrow::withdraw`])
//! - SME records optional **collateral commitments** ([`LiquifactEscrow::record_sme_collateral_commitment`]) —
//!   these are **ledger records only**; they do **not** move tokens, freeze balances,
//!   reserve assets, or create an enforceable on-chain claim.
//! - [`LiquifactEscrow::settle`] finalizes the escrow after maturity (when configured).
//!
//! ## Schema version ([`SCHEMA_VERSION`] / [`DataKey::Version`])
//!
//! The constant [`SCHEMA_VERSION`] is written to [`DataKey::Version`] by [`LiquifactEscrow::init`]
//! and is the canonical source of truth for upgrade decisions. **Current value: 6.**
//!
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::migrate`] **fails with typed errors in all current execution paths** — no
//! silent migration work is promised or performed. Operators must extend `migrate` before calling
//! it, or redeploy when stored struct layout changes. See `docs/OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md` for the full
//! decision tree.
//!
//! ## Event topic versioning ([`EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`])
//!
//! Every lifecycle event emitted by this contract includes a schema version
//! as the second topic element: `(event_name, EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION, ...)`.
//! The version is set by the [`EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`] constant and lets
//! off-chain consumers detect breaking changes before parsing the payload.
//! The required payload fields for each event are stable within a schema
//! version; a bump to [`EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`] means new events or fields may
//! be present, and consumers should switch on this version explicitly.
//!
//! ## SME collateral commitment metadata
//!
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::record_sme_collateral_commitment`] is an SME-authenticated metadata write for
//! off-chain risk review. The stored [`SmeCollateralCommitment`] and emitted
//! [`CollateralRecordedEvt`] are not proof of custody, lien, encumbrance, asset control, or token
//! movement. Risk teams and indexers must label this state as reported collateral metadata and must
//! verify supporting evidence outside this contract.
//!
//! ## Compliance hold (legal hold)
//!
//! An admin may set [`DataKey::LegalHold`] to block risk-bearing transitions until cleared:
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::settle`], SME [`LiquifactEscrow::withdraw`], and
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::claim_investor_payout`]. **Clearing** requires the **current**
//! [`InvoiceEscrow::admin`] to call [`LiquifactEscrow::set_legal_hold`] with `active = false`
//! (or [`LiquifactEscrow::clear_legal_hold`]). This contract does not embed a timelock or
//! council multisig: production deployments **must** use a governed `admin` (multisig or
//! protocol DAO) so a single lost key cannot strand funds indefinitely.
//!
//! **Failure mode:** a hold plus loss of the current admin signing key leaves funds blocked
//! on-chain until governance regains control of admin authority. There is no break-glass bypass.
//!
//! **Recovery lever:** [`LiquifactEscrow::propose_admin`] and
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::accept_admin`] are **not** gated by the hold. Governance proposes a new
//! admin, the proposed address accepts, then the new admin clears the hold. Invariant: a hold is
//! always clearable by whoever holds `InvoiceEscrow::admin`; recovery requires controlling that
//! authority. See `docs/escrow-legal-hold.md` and [ADR-004](docs/adr/ADR-004-legal-hold.md).
//!
//! ## Authorization guard ordering
//!
//! Every state-mutating entrypoint follows a canonical sequence (see
//! `docs/escrow-security-checklist.md` §6 and [ADR-002](docs/adr/ADR-002-auth-boundaries.md)):
//!
//! 1. **Read-only** preconditions (legal hold, status checks, input validation).
//! 2. **`Address::require_auth()`** for the bound role ([Stellar authorization](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/guides/auth/contract-authorization)).
//! 3. **Storage writes** and **SEP-41 transfers** (via [`external_calls`]).
//!
//! Invariant: no instance/persistent storage mutation and no token transfer occurs until
//! step 2 succeeds. Reading [`DataKey::Escrow`] before `require_auth` is intentional — it is
//! read-only and does not weaken the auth boundary.
//!
//! ## Invoice identifier (`invoice_id`)
//!
//! At initialization, `invoice_id` is supplied as a Soroban [`String`] and validated for length
//! and charset before conversion to [`Symbol`] for storage. Align off-chain invoice slugs with the
//! same rules (ASCII alphanumeric + `_`, max length [`MAX_INVOICE_ID_STRING_LEN`]) so indexers stay
//! unambiguous.
//!
//! ## Funding token and registry (immutable hints)
//!
//! Each escrow instance binds exactly one **funding token** contract ([`DataKey::FundingToken`])
//! at [`LiquifactEscrow::init`]; it cannot be changed after deploy. An optional **registry**
//! ([`DataKey::RegistryRef`]) is a read-only discoverability hint only — it is **not** an authority
//! for this contract and must not be used on-chain as proof of registry state without calling the
//! registry yourself.
//!
//! ## Terminal dust sweep
//!
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::sweep_terminal_dust`] moves at most [`MAX_DUST_SWEEP_AMOUNT`] units of the
//! bound funding token from this contract to the immutable **treasury** address, only when the
//! escrow has reached a **terminal** [`InvoiceEscrow::status`] (settled, withdrawn, or cancelled).
//! It cannot run during a legal hold. Transfers go through [`crate::external_calls`] so **pre/post
//! token balances** must match the requested amount (standard SEP-41 behavior); fee-on-transfer or
//! malicious tokens are **explicitly out of scope** and fail with typed errors at the balance-check
//! boundary. This is meant for rounding residue / stray transfers, not for settling live liabilities —
//! integrations that custody principal on-chain must keep token balances reconciled with
//! `funded_amount` so treasury sweeps cannot pull user funds.
//!
//! ## Ledger time trust model
//!
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::settle`] and [`LiquifactEscrow::claim_investor_payout`] compare against
//! [`Env::ledger`] timestamps only (no wall-clock oracle). Maturity, per-investor **claim locks**
//! from [`LiquifactEscrow::fund_with_commitment`], and [`FundingCloseSnapshot`] metadata must be
//! interpreted as **validator-observed ledger time**, including possible skew between simulated and
//! live networks—integrators should treat boundaries as `>=` / `<` tests on integer seconds.
//!
//! ## Optional tiered yield (immutable table at init)
//!
//! Pass `yield_tiers` to [`LiquifactEscrow::init`] as [`Option`] of a Soroban [`Vec`] of [`YieldTier`].
//! The table is **immutable** for the escrow instance. Investors who use [`LiquifactEscrow::fund_with_commitment`]
//! on their **first** deposit select an effective [`DataKey::InvestorEffectiveYield`] from the ladder;
//! further principal from that address must use [`LiquifactEscrow::fund`]. **Fairness:** tiers are
//! validated non-decreasing in both `min_lock_secs` and `yield_bps` relative to the base [`InvoiceEscrow::yield_bps`].
//!
//! ## Funding-close snapshot (pro-rata)
//!
//! When status first becomes **funded**, [`DataKey::FundingCloseSnapshot`] stores total principal
//! (including over-funding past target), the target, and ledger timestamp/sequence. **Immutable** once
//! written; see `docs/escrow-pro-rata.md` for the authoritative pro-rata payout math and rounding rules.
//! Off-chain share for an investor is `get_contribution(addr) / snapshot.total_principal`.
//!
//! ## Immutable protocol fee (SME disbursement split)
//!
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::init`] accepts an optional `protocol_fee_bps` (basis points, `0..=10_000`,
//! default `0`) stored immutably under [`DataKey::ProtocolFeeBps`]. At
//! [`LiquifactEscrow::withdraw`] the funded principal is split:
//!
//! ```text
//! fee        = funded_amount * protocol_fee_bps / 10_000   (floor, checked)
//! sme_payout = funded_amount - fee                          (checked)
//! ```
//!
//! `fee` is routed to [`DataKey::Treasury`] and `sme_payout` to [`InvoiceEscrow::sme_address`].
//! **Conservation invariant:** `sme_payout + fee == funded_amount` for every withdrawal, so no
//! principal is created or destroyed by the split. Rounding is **floor**, so any sub-`10_000`
//! residue stays with the SME (never over-charges the treasury). With `protocol_fee_bps == 0`
//! the behavior is byte-for-byte identical to the pre-fee contract: the full `funded_amount`
//! goes to the SME and no treasury transfer occurs.
//!
//! **Interaction with on-chain disbursement:** the fee is only realized when principal is
//! custodied on-chain and the SME calls [`LiquifactEscrow::withdraw`] — this feature depends on
//! the on-chain disbursement path. It does **not** apply to off-chain settlement
//! ([`LiquifactEscrow::settle`]), investor refunds ([`LiquifactEscrow::refund`]), or investor
//! claims ([`LiquifactEscrow::claim_investor_payout`]). The treasury here is the same immutable
//! address used by [`LiquifactEscrow::sweep_terminal_dust`]; the fee transfer reuses the same
//! SEP-41 balance-delta–checked path in [`external_calls`].

    ///
    /// ## Additive-key safety contract (ADR-007, Rule 1)
    ///
    /// A WASM upgrade is safe when the new WASM only **adds** new `DataKey` variants that:
    /// 1. Are read with `.get(...).unwrap_or(default)` so pre-existing instances return
    ///    the expected default when the key is absent.
    /// 2. Do not change the XDR shape of any existing stored `#[contracttype]` struct
    ///    (e.g. `InvoiceEscrow`, `FundingCloseSnapshot`, `YieldTier`, `SmeCollateralCommitment`).
    /// 3. Do not rename or remove any existing `DataKey` variant.
    ///
    /// **Critically: `DataKey` variant ordering in the enum determines the XDR discriminant
    /// (encoded as an integer). Reordering existing variants changes their on-chain discriminant,
    /// causing reads of those keys to silently decode the wrong storage slot or return nothing.
    /// Never reorder existing `DataKey` variants; only append new ones at the end of the enum.**
    ///
    /// A WASM upgrade is **unsafe / breaking** when:
    /// - An existing `DataKey` variant is renamed, removed, or reordered.
    /// - An existing stored `#[contracttype]` struct gains a non-optional field.
    /// - An existing stored `#[contracttype]` struct changes a field type.
    /// - The XDR discriminant of any existing variant changes (caused by reordering).
    ///
    /// These breaking changes require either a `migrate` path (extend `migrate` first,
    /// then upgrade, then call `migrate`) or a full redeploy. See `docs/OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md` §1
    /// and `docs/adr/ADR-007-storage-key-evolution.md` for the decision tree.
    ///
    /// ## Event emission (before deployer call)
    ///
    /// A [`ContractUpgraded`] event is emitted *before* the deployer call as a defensive
    /// ordering: the event is recorded even if the deployer interaction somehow reverts.
    /// The event carries `invoice_id` (for indexer correlation) and `new_wasm_hash`.
    ///
    /// ## When to call `migrate` after upgrading
    ///
    /// - **Additive-only new `DataKey` variants**: do **not** call `migrate()`. Old instances
    ///   return defaults for absent keys; no rewrite is needed.
    /// - **Schema-breaking changes where `migrate()` has been extended**: call `migrate(stored_version)`
    ///   after the upgrade. The stored version before upgrade is readable via `get_version()`.
    /// - **Current release (SCHEMA_VERSION = 6)**: `migrate()` errors on all paths.
    ///   Do not call it as a bookkeeping step after an additive upgrade.
    ///
    /// ## Operator pre-flight checklist
    ///
    /// Before invoking `upgrade` on a live instance, operators must:
    /// 1. Activate a legal hold (`set_legal_hold(true)`) to block in-flight settlements/claims.
    /// 2. Build and upload the new WASM: `cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release`.
    /// 3. Upload to the network: `stellar contract upload --wasm ...` → captures `NEW_WASM_HASH`.
    /// 4. Diff the new `DataKey` enum against the deployed version: verify only additive changes.
    /// 5. Test on Testnet with a mirror instance before Mainnet.
    /// 6. Call `upgrade(NEW_WASM_HASH)` with admin credentials.
    /// 7. Verify `get_version()` and `get_escrow()` return expected values.
    /// 8. Clear legal hold: `clear_legal_hold()`.
    /// See `docs/OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md` §§3–7 for the complete procedure.
    ///
    /// ## Rollback
    ///
    /// Re-upload the previous WASM (already recorded on-chain) and call `upgrade(PREV_WASM_HASH)`.
    /// This works only when stored data is still compatible with old WASM types. If stored data
    /// was already rewritten by a `migrate` call, rollback requires a redeploy.
    ///
    /// ## Risks
    ///
    /// Deploying an incompatible WASM (one that reorders or removes existing `DataKey` variants,
    /// or changes a stored struct's XDR shape) will silently corrupt stored state on the next read.
