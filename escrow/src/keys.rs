#![allow(dead_code)]
//! Centralized constructors for funding-related storage keys.
//!
//! # Purpose
//!
//! All persistent and instance-storage keys are defined here as variants of [`DataKey`].
//! Typed constructor functions are provided for every key family so that call sites never
//! build a [`DataKey`] inline — reducing the risk of typos, discriminant drift between
//! modules, and copy-paste errors when a new key needs to be added.
//!
//! ## Collateral keys
//!
//! The collateral pledge key family is managed by [`collateral_pledge_key`]. All three
//! collateral entrypoints (`record_sme_collateral_commitment`, `clear_sme_collateral_commitment`,
//! `get_sme_collateral_commitment`) call this function instead of constructing
//! `DataKey::SmeCollateralPledge` inline. This ensures any future rename or split of the
//! collateral key cannot diverge across call sites.
//!
//! ## Additive-key policy (ADR-007)
//!
//! Adding a new variant is **backward-compatible** when the new key is read with
//! `.unwrap_or(default)` and its absence does not change existing entrypoint semantics.
//! Renaming a variant, changing its XDR discriminant, or altering the stored type of an
//! existing key is **breaking** and requires a `migrate` path or a full redeploy.

// Key-builder helpers are part of the crate's public API for symmetry. Call sites
// currently use `DataKey::Variant` literals inline; the helpers are kept so the
// indirection layer remains available without churn if/when callers migrate.
