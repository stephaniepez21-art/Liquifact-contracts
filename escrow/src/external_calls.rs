/// Hardened wrappers around cross-contract calls used by this escrow.
///
/// This crate only performs **token** transfers on the address stored under
/// [`crate::DataKey::FundingToken`] after initialization. That address must be a **standard*
/// [SEP-41](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0041.md)-style
/// token with no fee-on-transfer or balance-deficit behavior: post-transfer balance **deltas** must
/// match the requested `amount` exactly on both sides.
///
/// ## Balance-delta invariants
///
/// All transfers enforce strict pre/post balance checks to ensure mathematical conservation of value:
/// - **Sender**: balance must decrease by exactly `amount`
/// - **Recipient**: balance must increase by exactly `amount`
/// - **Muxed mapping**: recipient address is wrapped in [`MuxedAddress`] for Stellar compatibility
/// - **Safe failure**: any deviation causes immediate panic with descriptive error message
///
/// The invariants are enforced through atomic balance verification:
/// 1. Capture pre-transfer balances for both parties
/// 2. Execute the transfer using standard SEP-41 interface
/// 3. Capture post-transfer balances and calculate exact deltas
/// 4. Assert mathematical equality: `sender_delta == recipient_delta == amount`
///
/// ## Additional state invariants enforced (Issue #1257)
///
/// Beyond balance-delta checks, the following structural invariants are enforced **before** any
/// SEP-41 transfer executes, preventing a class of silent-integrity bugs:
///
/// **INVARIANT 1 — Distinct sender and recipient:**
/// `from != to` (outbound) and `investor != to` (inbound). A self-transfer circumvents the
/// balance-delta conservation model: the same address would appear as both sides, so any
/// balance mutation could be "explained away" while no net movement actually occurs.
/// Enforced with [`EscrowError::TransferSameSenderRecipient`] /
/// [`EscrowError::InboundTransferSameSenderRecipient`].
///
/// **INVARIANT 2 — Amount positivity:**
/// `amount > 0` is verified before any balance read, so the downstream `checked_sub` deltas
/// never degenerate to zero or negative. Enforced with [`EscrowError::TransferAmountNotPositive`]
/// / [`EscrowError::InboundTransferAmountNotPositive`].
///
/// **INVARIANT 3 — Sufficient sender balance pre-transfer:**
/// `sender_before >= amount` is asserted against the actual SEP-41 balance so a transfer that
/// would fail inside the token host (and possibly leave state partially mutated on a
/// non-compliant token) is short-circuited here.
///
/// **INVARIANT 4 — Deterministic underflow-free deltas:**
/// `spent = from_before.checked_sub(from_after)` and
/// `received = to_after.checked_sub(to_before)` must be `Some(...)`. An underflow indicates
/// the token's balance model is non-monotonic (rebasing / hooking) and such tokens are
/// explicitly out of scope.
///
/// **INVARIANT 5 — Exact conservation:**
/// `spent == amount && received == amount`. Any delta mismatch is a SEP-41 deviation:
/// fee-on-transfer, rebasing, or an integration bug that miscounted balances. Fail hard.
///
/// ## Test reality and verification
///
/// The test suite validates these invariants through:
/// - Standard token transfers with exact delta verification
/// - Edge cases including zero/negative amounts and insufficient balance
/// - Multiple transfer scenarios to ensure cumulative consistency
/// - Mocked token scenarios (where feasible) to detect divergence
///
/// ## Out-of-scope token economics
///
/// Malicious, rebasing, or "hook" tokens are **explicitly out of scope** and will cause safe-failure
/// panics at the balance-check boundary. If such tokens bypass these checks, they must be excluded
/// by governance allowlists and integration review. Fee-on-transfer tokens are not supported.
///
/// Specifically excluded:
/// - Tokens with transfer fees (fee-on-transfer)
/// - Rebasing tokens that change total supply
/// - Tokens with hooks or callbacks that modify balances
/// - Tokens with non-standard balance accounting
///
/// ## Governance allowlists
///
/// Integration review and governance allowlists are the primary defense mechanisms against
/// out-of-scope token economics. The balance-delta checks serve as a technical safety net,
/// but proper token selection through governance processes remains essential.
///
/// # Soroban execution and "reentrancy"
///
/// Unlike many EVM environments, Soroban does not allow the classic pattern of an external call
/// immediately re-entering the same contract mid-host-function in an interleaved way: the token
/// host function runs to completion before this contract resumes. **Still** treat the token as
/// adversarial for **correctness of balances**: always record pre/post balances around transfers so
/// integration bugs and non-compliant tokens are caught at the host boundary.
///
/// ## Reviewer timeline (host-call boundary)
///
/// `transfer_funding_token_with_balance_checks` follows this sequence:
/// 1. INVARIANT: assert sender != recipient (self-transfer guard).
/// 2. INVARIANT: assert amount > 0 (positivity guard).
/// 3. Read sender/recipient balances before transfer.
/// 4. INVARIANT: assert sender balance >= amount (sufficiency guard).
/// 5. Invoke SEP-41 `transfer` on the configured token contract.
/// 6. Soroban host executes that token call to completion, then returns.
/// 7. Read sender/recipient balances after transfer.
/// 8. Compute deltas via checked_sub — underflow ⇒ invariant violation.
/// 9. INVARIANT: assert exact conservation (`spent == amount` and `received == amount`).
///
/// Security takeaway: this is not relying on "non-reentrancy" as a magic property. It enforces
/// post-call accounting invariants at the external-call boundary where token behavior is observed.
